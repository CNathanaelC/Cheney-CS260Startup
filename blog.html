                <p>Welcome to my blog! This is where I am going to starting posting some of my day-to-day experiences with hiking and exploring in various areas!
                    I won't reveal where I am going exploring first since I'm not sure I want to dox it quite yet, since its pretty secluded and out of the 
                    the eyes of the public. However, I can't wait for each of you to experience this wonderful hike and its surrounding area once I do. Keep posted for updates
                which should be recurring in the coming weeks. Thanks for joining me on this journey!</p>
