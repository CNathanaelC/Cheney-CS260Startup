            <p>Welcome to my blog! This is where I am going to starting posting some of my day-to-day experiences with
                hiking and exploring in various areas!
                I won't reveal where I am going exploring first since I'm not sure I want to dox it quite yet, since its
                pretty secluded and out of the
                the eyes of the public. However, I can't wait for each of you to experience this wonderful hike and its
                surrounding area once I do. Keep posted for updates
                which should be recurring in the coming weeks. Thanks for joining me on this journey!</p>

                After a couple preliminary searches for the location, it seems the internet doesn't even know where this
                is, so I'll go ahead and share it. For this season
                of the blog, I will traveling around Skulchon Lake its associated town. I know I said that I would be
                updating sooner, but it looks like I need to figure
                out a couple more things.
