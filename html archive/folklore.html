            <p>
                There is a ramp that is part of the original building where boys would run back and
                forth as they would work at the stables, it is believed that this area is still haunted
                by quite a few of them. Some sightings have stated that they have seen a boy that stands
                in their shop, wearing a white shirt and a black vest. In addition, he has no eyes.

            <p>
                Lake Chelan is the deepest known lake in Washington state and the third deepest
                in the United States as a whole. Reaching as far back as 1812, reports of a giant
                winged lizard was rumored to make its lair at the lake and to cause general havoc.

            <h3 id="CultQL" class="glitch">The Skulchon Cult</h3>
            <p>
                In the early 1900's this cult was reportedly operating near the North Cascades region of Washington
                state.
                After multiple drowning cases that were originally ruled as accidents or suicides, it came to light that
                a religious cult was responsible. As several members of the cult were found out and arrested, the rest
                of
                the members of the cult met at Skulchon Lake on Midsummer and drowned themselves. Extensive
                information regarding their
                beliefs or motives for the murders was never ascertained, but it is rumored that they believed that they
                were to bring the victims to their god.
