                <p>
                    There is a ramp that is part of the original building where boys would run back and 
                    forth as they would work at the stables, it is believed that this area is still haunted
                    by quite a few of them. Some sightings have stated that they have seen a boy that stands
                    in their shop, wearing a white shirt and a black vest. In addition, he has no eyes.

                <p>
                    Lake Chelan is the deepest known lake in Washington state and the third deepest
                    in the United States as a whole. Reaching as far back as 1812, reports of a giant
                    winged lizard was rumored to make its lair at the lake and to cause general havoc.

                <p>
                    In the early 1900's this cult was reportedly operating in the central north region of washington state.
                    After multiple drowning cases that were originally ruled as accidents or suicides, it came to light that 
                    a religious cult was responsible. As several members of the cult were found out and arrested, the rest of
                    the members of the cult met at Skulchon Lake on Midsummer and drowned themselves. Extensive information regarding their
                    beliefs or motives for the murders was never ascertained, but it is rumored that they believed that they
                    were to bring the victims to their god.
